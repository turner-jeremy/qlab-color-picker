# QLab Color Picker

HTML Color Picker for QLab cues

A simple interface to display all colors available in QLab and copy them to your clipboard to use in custom scripts.

There is also an option to copy the color name along with a simple script to change color of selected cues with QLab.

Works for QLab versions 4 and 5.

Not affiliated at all with Figure 53, just made for fun.
